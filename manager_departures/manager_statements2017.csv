richiewellens,2018-06-08,Oldham Athletic,233 days,2018,"Oldham Athletic can confirm that the contract of manager Richie Wellens has been terminated with immediate effect.

We would like to thank Richie for all his efforts.

Whilst he was unable to guide us to League One safety after being appointed in October, it certainly wasn’t due to a lack of professionalism and dedication on his part and we wish him every success for the future.

The club will look to appoint a new manager as soon as possible and will be making no further comment at this time."
darrenferguson,2018-06-04,Doncaster Rovers,962 days,2018,"Following conversations between the board of Doncaster Rovers and Darren Ferguson, the club can confirm that we have parted ways.

paultisdale,2018-06-01,Exeter City,4358 days,2018,"Exeter City has been negotiating a new, significantly improved, contract with its manager Paul Tisdale for many months, having commenced this process in the middle of 2017.

The time extended and formally advised to Paul for him to provide an answer to the question as to whether he was to sign the new contract which was offered to him, so he would continue as the club’s manager has now passed. The club is sad to report that Paul therefore will be leaving after 12 years as manager.

Julian Tagg, chairman of Exeter City FC, said the club had offered the best remuneration it possibly could to keep Paul at Exeter. He added: “Regretfully, Paul has decided not to sign.”

“We wish him the best of luck for the future and would like to thank him for his commitment to our club over the last 12 years. He has been a dedicated and successful manager, well respected both inside the Club and equally so in football generally and ever popular with players staff and volunteers, having worked so extremely hard to bring Exeter City to where we are today.

“Our offer of a new contract to Paul came with our express desire that he sign it in order to allow the club to plan and go forward with certainty. It is of course entirely Paul’s prerogative that he should choose to let the club’s deadline for a decision pass, but we are now at the point where we must move on and unexpectedly plan for a future without Paul as our manager.”

Mr Tagg added: “Despite the disappointment of not achieving promotion to League One, it is important to acknowledge Paul’s stewardship of the team, guiding them through the tense play-off period. When put in context, to finish fourth in the league is a fantastic achievement.

“Under Paul’s leadership, we have consistently outperformed clubs with much larger budgets and we feel incredibly proud of everything we’ve achieved together, on and off the pitch.”

He added: “We’ll continue to watch Paul’s career with great interest. He has been Exeter City’s most successful ever manager and he will always be welcome here and we wish him well.”"
johnsheridan,2018-06-01,Fleetwood Town,99 days,2018,"Oldham Athletic (2004) AFC Limited can confirm that first team manager, John Sheridan, has left the club by mutual consent.

The Board of Directors would like to place on record their thanks to John for his contribution to the development of the club, not only during this tenure, but as both a player and manager previously.

His impact over the past two seasons in particular, when he has saved the club from near certain relegation on both occasions, will mean he is always guaranteed a warm welcome here by both the club and fans alike.

This season, however, has not seen the progression we hoped with what was felt to be the nucleus of a good squad, and results, performances and league position have been hugely disappointing.

Therefore following discussions with John, this decision has been made in the best interests of the club. We wish John well for the future.

“Our objective is to bring in a Head Coach with more experience who can help us reach the goals we have talked about since we became custodians of the club last summer. We are confident of making a quick appointment and we thank our fans for their continued support.”

paulhurst,2018-05-30,Shrewsbury Town,583 days,2018,"Shrewsbury Town can confirm that manager Paul Hurst has left the club to take up the vacant managers job with Championship side Ipswich Town.

The move brings to an end 18 months of Hurst being in charge of Town that has seen two great seasons in the clubs history.

In his first year in charge Hurst managed to take a Town side, which looked in danger of relegation to safety.  The second season saw Town stay in the top 3 of the Sky Bet League One for the majority of the season, but it ended in heartache with a defeat to Rotherham in the Play-off Final.

Hurst had been linked with a number of jobs during his time in charge at Town but towards the end of the season rumours that Ipswich were interested in his services began to surface.

Ipswich made contact with the club to talk to Paul on Monday.  Discussions have taken place since then and personal terms have been agreed,

“I’d like to thank Shrewsbury for giving me the chance to manage at League One level”, said Paul.

“It was an unbelievable season and just disappointing that we couldn’t cap it off in the way we would have liked to. 

“I had an excellent relationship with everyone at the club and I’d like to wish Shrewsbury the best of fortunes going forward but when this opportunity came up, it was just too good to turn down.

Assistant manager Chris Doig will also be moving with Paul to join Ipswich Town,

Everyone at Shrewsbury Town would like to thank Paul and Chris for all they have done in their 18 months with the club and wish them well for the future."

The Swans will start the search for a new boss after opting to make a change following their relegation from the Premier League.

The club can also confirm first-team coaches Joao Mario and Bruno Lage have left the Liberty Stadium along with match analysts Jhony Conceicao and Paulo Sampaio.


Swans chairman Huw Jenkins said: â€œWeâ€™d like to put on record our thanks to Carlos for his enthusiasm, hard work and commitment since arriving at the club in December.

â€œNaturally, we are all disappointed with the clubâ€™s relegation from the Premier League, and following discussions with Carlos, we felt it was in the best interests of both parties that we move in a new direction.

â€œWe will now be looking to appoint a new manager in readiness for the 2018-19 season.


â€œWhile there are already rumours linking us with several managers, it is vital that we identify the right person to take this team forward.â€

Carvalhal took charge at the Liberty Stadium on December 28, agreeing a deal until the end of the season.

The Portuguese enjoyed a number of successes in his first few months at the helm, steering the Swans to five victories in his first nine league games.

That impressive sequence saw Carvalhalâ€™s team climb off the bottom of the Premier League and out of the relegation places.

But the Swansâ€™ failure to win any of their final nine league games of the campaign saw them drop out of the top flight on the last day of the season.

Everyone at Swansea City would like to thank Carlos and his staff for all their efforts and wish them all the best in their future careers.

Sam was brought in at a challenging time last season to provide us with some stability and we are grateful to him for doing that.

A short while ago I had a meeting with the Chairman to let him know that I would not be continuing to manage his and your club.

Itâ€™s been an amazing, unforgettable 8 weeks with all the players and the positive energy and the enthusiasm from all the supporters has been quite overwhelming and I canâ€™t thank you enough.

The Chairman has offered me a fantastic contract, offered to increase the budget and had done everything he could and no blame what so ever can be put his way. For me, it was 8 weeks and I am happy but of course underneath Iâ€™m bitterly disappointed and still very upset that we were unable to retain our position in the Football League.

I really do hope Barnet Football Club can now grow with these players plus the addition of Johnson, Tarpey and Vilhete and you can all be proud to be Barnet supporters.

Take care,
Martin"

Everyone at Fleetwood Town would like to place on record their thanks to Uwe for his hard work and professionalism during his time at the club. 

The search for his replacement will begin immediately, with Barry Nicholson and David Lucas taking charge of Tuesdayâ€™s game against Portsmouth."
russellslade,2018-02-11,Grimsby Town,305 days,2018,"Grimsby Town Football Club can today announce that it has parted company with manager, Russell Slade after the recent downturn in results.

The Board of Directors would like to place on record their disappointment with this outcome, but believe there is little choice but to move forward with a new management team.

The Board acknowledge that the team have been extremely unlucky in recent weeks, but football is a game of fine margins and a results driven business.

As highlighted in recent weeks, this is not a decision we have taken lightly. While the Board continued to back Russell throughout the season and the recent transfer window, yesterdayâ€™s 3-0 defeat and a winless run of 12 games cannot be ignored. Despite speculation to the contrary, Russell was on a six month rolling contract, allowing the club the flexibility to make this decision.

We now believe moving forward with a new manager will help ensure the clubâ€™s consolidation in the Football League for the remainder of this season.

The Board would like to thank Russell for his efforts and hard work and are bitterly disappointed that this did not turn out differently. He had a strong working relationship with the Board and all involved are disappointed to see a good, hardworking and honest man, who cared intensely about the club, lose his job.

We wish Russell all the best for the future and thank him for some of the improvements he has implemented on and off the field.

Paul Wilkinson will take temporary charge of first team affairs until a replacement is found. A local man and a legend as a player, Paul acknowledges the opportunity and huge pride that comes with managing the club. He should be supported whilst the club search for a suitable replacement. Dave Moore and Andy Warrington will remain part of the coaching staff.

A competitive recruitment process will now take place until a suitable replacement is found. This is one of the most important appointments in the long history of the club and cannot be rushed, but it is important that we move swiftly with a new leader to turn around the current form.

We will make a statement at the earliest possible convenience. We will not be making any further comment until such time."

paulheckingbottom,2018-02-06,Barnsley,601 days,2018,"Barnsley Football Club are thoroughly disappointed to announce that Paul Heckingbottom has joined Leeds United.

The 40-year-old will move to Elland Road instantly. Heckingbottom will be joined by Jamie Clapham (First Team Coach), Nathan Winder (Head of Sports Science) and Alex Bailey (First Team Performance Analyst) who will also all depart Oakwell immediately. 

The Club are shocked at Paul Heckingbottomâ€™s desire to leave, having agreed a new contract with Barnsley Football Club last week following the completion of the January transfer window, where the Board of Directors worked tirelessly along with Paul to secure their targets, resulting in a successful window. This left the Club optimistic in a turnaround in form and a strong end to the 2017/18 campaign as we battle to retain our position in the league.

Barnsley Football Club Chief Executive Gauthier Ganaye commented: â€œYes, it was unexpected. Yes, it has come during an already complicated period. Yes, it will make things more difficult short term, but our Club is full of resources and it is certainly not dependent on one man alone. Iâ€™m asking everyone from the players, employees and our loyal fans to come together as we have an important game on Saturday.â€ 

The Club want to place on record their thanks and best wishes to Paul Heckingbottom and his coaching team. Having taken on the role of Head Coach in February 2016, he has guided his home town Club to promotion, a Johnstoneâ€™s Paint Trophy victory and the highest Sky Bet Championship finish in 20 years. 

Until a new Head Coach is appointed, Paul Harsley will take caretaker charge. The board fully trusts him to lead the team whilst getting the maximum levels out of the squad and we all support him in this new role as caretaker.

Ganaye added: â€œPaul Harsley knows the Club through and through. He has a sound knowledge of the Club as a whole and the team, which makes him the ideal person to lead us towards what is an important game for the town, the Club and the fans. Letâ€™s get behind them!â€

stuartmccall,2018-02-05,Bradford City,595 days,2018,"Bradford City can confirm that the club has terminated the contract of manager Stuart McCall.

This decision has not been taken lightly, and this is a sad day for everyone involved. 

We would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Stuart, who joined the club at a difficult time and restored the fans' belief when the odds were much against us.

Unfortunately, we have now suffered six straight defeats and the last two fixtures in particular have not brought about the positive change in performances or results that we all hoped for.

We believe that our current squad is capable of performing to a much higher standard than we have seen recently. We must all accept responsibility for the recent poor run of form, including our players who now have the opportunity to put it right.

As such, we believe that a change is in the best interests of the club at this time in order to give us the best chance of finishing the season strongly.

Finally, everyone at Bradford City would like to thank Stuart McCall for giving us all some wonderful memories. In two spells as a player and two as a manager, he has always given his absolute commitment to our club.

Stuart is a City Legend and always will be. He will, of course, always be welcome back at Valley Parade."

This has been a difficult decision and one not taken lightly. The Club is convinced the appointment of Silva was the right one and had it not been for the unwarranted approach by a Premier League rival for his services we would have continued to prosper under his leadership.
 
The catalyst for this decision is that unwarranted approach, something which the Board believes has seen a significant deterioration in both focus and results to the point where the long-term future of Watford FC has been jeopardised.
 
For the security and success of the football club, the Board believes it has to make a change. 
 
The Club will seek to make a swift appointment and there will be no further comment until that appointment has been made."

philbrown,2018-01-17,Southend United,1759 days,2018,"The Club has today placed its Manager, Phil Brown, on Gardening Leave whilst a settlement agreement is completed. Additionally the Club has today terminated the employment agreements of Graham Coughlan (Assistant Manager), Brian Horton (Football Coordinator) and Bob Shaw (Head of Recruitment). We wish to thank Phil Brownâ€™s back room staff and especially Graham Coughlan who has been a loyal employee of the Club, contributed continuously and without reservation, for some 8 years.

Phil Brown has been Manager of the Club for approaching five years during which time Southend United has enjoyed success including promotion in 2015 to League One. During this period Phil Brown has been instrumental in improving many aspects of the Club, including embracing the Academy above all other Managers, for which we sincerely thank him.

However this season, to date, has been a disappointment and has not reflected, in the Boardâ€™s opinion, the capability of the assembled squad or the investment.

Recent performances have been unacceptable and in the Board's view the lack of discipline, Nile Ranger a case in point, has only served to compound the position. The Club's success as we enter a new era is paramount and we shall adopt a zero tolerance in our efforts to achieve this objective. These are exciting times with everyone at the Club working earnestly, with the help of the Council, to deliver â€˜The Futureâ€™ for the benefit of the Town and its Football Club.

Moving forward the Club has identified a principal target and subject to securing his services will be tasked with replacing the management team without delay. Pending the Club's new appointment(s) Team affairs will be conducted by the Club's Academy Manager and Head of Under 23 Team, Ricky Duncan and Kevin Maher

The Club will of course keep supporters fully informed at all times and more particularly as matters are progressed regarding the identity and timing of a replacement Manager together with new signings.

Assistant coaches Nigel Gibbs and Karl Halabi have also left the club.

Swansea City chairman, Huw Jenkins, confirmed: â€œTo change the manager, especially at only the halfway point of the season, is the last thing we wanted to do as a club.

â€œWe had three different managers last season and as a result we all wanted to give Paul as much time as possible to turn things around.

â€œBut we felt we couldnâ€™t leave it any longer and needed to make a change to give us the best chance of an uplift and a turnaround in fortunes with the club bottom of the Premier League.

â€œPaul has been at the club for 12 months and what he achieved in the second half of last season to keep us in the top flight was a tremendous feat. For that, and his effort and commitment this season, it goes without saying that the club thanks him for his work, together with Nigel (Gibbs) and Karl (Halabi).

â€œI have had an excellent working relationship with Paul and we are all, including the owners, surprised and disappointed it hasnâ€™t worked out this season.

â€œWe wish Paul every success in his career going forward.â€™â€™


The club will give supporters a further update regarding their replacements within the next 24 hours.

Clement was appointed head coach on January 3, 2017, after the dismissal of Bob Bradley as manager.

He arrived with a wealth of experience after working with some of the biggest teams in Europe as assistant manager to Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain.

He also replaced former England boss Steve McClaren as manager of Championship side Derby County; taking the Rams to fifth in the table before being relieved of his duties.

In terms of silverware, Clement helped Chelsea to the Premier League title in 2013, while the year before he had seen Paris Saint-Germain win Ligue 1. His crowning moment came with Real Madrid, for whom he was part of the set-up when they lifted a tenth Champions League title along with winning the Copa Del Rey.


Clement's other roles included working in the youth set up at Fulham along with a short spell with Republic of Ireland Under-21s.

He took over at Swansea last season with the club bottom of the Premier League and tipped as odds-on favourites for relegation. But he sparked a remarkable turnaround with four wins from his first six games, including an impressive victory at Liverpool, to earn himself the Premier League Manager of the Month award for January.

With things looking up, a poor run of six games without a win put the Swans in trouble again and relegation looked a serious possibility.

The Great Escape was complete, however, when Clement led his side to four wins and a draw from the last five games to finish the campaign in 15th place and six points clear of the drop zone.

But Clement couldnâ€™t repeat last seasonâ€™s late form with just three wins and three draws from the opening 18 games leaving the Swans bottom of the Premier League again on 12 points.

Swansea City would like to thank Paul, Nigel and Karl for their services and commitment to the club and wish them well in their next challenges."
