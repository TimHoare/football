# Analysing Club Statements For Managerial Departures in 2017-18

The idea for this analysis is shamelessly stolen from an piece by [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46875479)

### Getting the data 

The basic information, such as manager name, club name and leaving date was obtained from www.thesackrace.com. In this analysis we will
be looking at the 67 manager sackings/departures in professional English football in 2017/18. The content from the club statements
for these departures was laboriously copy-and-pasted into .txt files then joined onto the table containing the basic info.

Note that the club statement is missing in some cases; this is simply because it was either too challenging to find or could not 
be copy-and-pasted.
